Script to automate reading list for Ebook readers

## Base Wishlist
All of the following is yet to be implemented:

- Maintain a list of URLs to get content from
  - Group them by document to enable several docs
- Check if the docs have changed (maintain a local copy and compare)
  -  Autoupdate if the docs changed
- Define what contents to "extract" (e.g.: get everything under div tagged as "main")
- Download and adapt src for images
