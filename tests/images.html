                                 <p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into
                                    a virtual network that you've
                                    		defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd
                                    operate in
                                    		your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of
                                    AWS.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon EC2. If you're new to Amazon EC2, see

                                 <p>A <em>virtual private cloud</em> (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your
                                    				AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.
                                    				You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.
                                    You can
                                    				specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, associate security groups,
                                    and 
                                    				configure route tables.
                                 </p>
                                 			
                                 <p>A <em>subnet</em> is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS
                                    resources into a specified subnet. Use a public subnet for resources that must be
                                    connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be
                                    connected to the internet .
                                 </p>
                                 			
                                 <p>To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security,
                                    including security groups and network access control lists (ACL).
                                 </p>

                                       VPC</em> that has a <em>default subnet</em> in each
                                    Availability Zone. A default VPC has the benefits of the advanced features provided
                                    by EC2-VPC, and is ready for you to use. If you have a default VPC and don't specify

                                    launch an instance, the instance is launched into your default VPC. 
                                    You can launch instances into your default VPC without needing to know 
                                    anything about Amazon VPC.

                                    				which routes traffic from the instance to the internet gateway, and routes any

                                    Alternatively, instances can initiate outbound connections to the internet over IPv6

                                    				and operate our networks to minimize packet loss. We measure packet-loss rate
                                    (PLR)
                                    				across the global backbone that connects the AWS Regions. We operate our backbone
                                    				network to target a p99 of the hourly PLR of less than 0.0001%.
